# Description:
Matte (mat) adjective. Having a dull or lusterless surface: matte paint; a matte complexion; a photograph with a matte finish.

The Matte Suite is a collection of themes inspired by GNOME-Colors and based on my previous MatteGlass theme. It is my intention to go the opposite direction of most Murrine themes... No gradients. No glossiness. No pixmaps. And almost no code.

There are 2 variations for each of the 6 GNOME-Colors color schemes. MatteCE features colorful titlebars and scrollbars, while MattePE inherits it's colors from bg_color.

In screenshots:
1. MatteCE-Brave
2. MattePE-Brave (w/ gnome-tribute)
3. MattePE-Dust

Enjoy :)
